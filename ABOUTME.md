- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hunter-elle
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, data hoarding (although I do not have enough memory, literally and physically). Coding always interests me but I've seen it as taxing. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in uni, completely unrelated to coding. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: message me here, or if you know me on discord, then go. I doubt you'll find something interesting.
